\title{Create a Quarto SCSS file}
\usage{
write_scss(name = "custom", path = getwd())
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{The name of the scss file without extension. Default \code{name} is
"custom".}

\item{path}{The path to the main project level. Defaults to the current
working directory}
}
\value{
A \code{.scss} file to customize Quarto styling. If \code{name} is not
"custom", the function will also attempt to update the Quarto document's YAML to
include the new SCSS file while preserving any existing SCSS configurations.
}
\description{
This function creates the \code{.scss} file so that any Quarto project can be easily
customized with SCSS styling variables, mixins, and rules. When creating additional
SCSS files beyond the default \code{custom.scss}, the function will automatically
update the YAML of your Quarto document while preserving any existing SCSS
configurations.
}
\details{
The function includes a robust YAML handling mechanism that:
\itemize{
  \item Preserves existing YAML structure and indentation
  \item Safely adds new SCSS files without disrupting existing ones
  \item Provides manual instructions if the YAML structure differs from expected
}

you with over 1500 lines of SCSS variables.
