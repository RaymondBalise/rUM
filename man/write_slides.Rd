\usage{
write_slides(
  filenames,
  path = here::here(),
  new_folder = "slides",
  example = FALSE,
  template = "none",

)
}
\arguments{
\item{filenames}{Character vector with minimal length of 1. This allows for the ability

the current project's base directory.}

\item{new_folder}{Character. Default folder is \code{"slides"}. Options are:

  * \code{"none"}: No folder is created. All files (.qmd & other) are created
  in the working directory (path of \code{here::here()}).

  * \code{"all"}: One folder is created for each value in the length of
  \code{filenames}.

  * \code{"slide_"}: One folder is created by appending "slides_" to the first file
  in \code{filenames} argument. If \code{filenames = "day_1"}, then the folder will
  be named \code{"slides_day_1"}.

  * A character value.}

including content.}

\item{template}{Character. Whether to include a slide template for common slide
  layouts and formatting (default: "none")
