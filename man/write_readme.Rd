\title{Create a project README file}
\usage{
write_readme(path = getwd())
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The path to the main project level. Defaults to the current
working directory.}
}
\value{
Creates or updates two files:
\itemize{
  \item README.md: A comprehensive template for project documentation
  \item dated_progress_notes.md: A chronological project progress tracker
}
}
\description{
This function streamlines project documentation by creating and managing both README.md
and dated_progress_notes.md files. It provides interactive prompts for existing files
and maintains consistent project documentation structure.
}
\details{
The README.md template includes structured sections for:
\itemize{
  \item Project description (study name, principal investigator, author)
  \item Project setup steps for reproducibility
  \item File and directory descriptions
  \item Miscellaneous project notes
}

The dated_progress_notes.md file is initialized with the current date and is designed
to help track project milestones chronologically.

For both files, if they already exist, the user will be prompted before any
overwriting occurs. The templates include example documentation that can be
modified to suit your specific project needs.
