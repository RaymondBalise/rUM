## Introduction

The `rUM` package installs several R Markdown document templates into the RStudio menus.  These include a YAML header (where you can specify your name and the project name) and chunks to enable the `tidyverse` package (to help with data processing), `tidymodels` package (to help with modeling) and the `conflicted` package^[The `conflicted` package watches to make sure that you are not using a function that is defined twice.  Say you use a package called "insults" which has a function called `mean()`.  If you type `mean(bob)`, it is unclear if you want to calculate an average (using the `mean()` function in the base R package: `base::mean()`) or use a mean insult (with the `mean()` function in the insults package `insults::mean()`). `conflicted` will ask you to specify which function you want to use.]. 

There is also a setup code chunk that set options to: 

+ show and hide code, messages and warnings 
+ stop R from printing ## in the output
+ set number rounding to 3 decimal places 


## Using Code Templates in RStudio

There are four templates

1. **html2 with rUM** : A basic web page
1. **html2 Details with rUM**: A web page with more details
1. **pdf2 showing LaTeX with rUM**: A pdf (with options to control tables' and figures' location and appearance)
1. **bookdown_site with rUM**: The structure of a book

You access the templates from the File menu by choosing 

1. New File > R Markdown... ![Picture showing File menu with New File > Rmarkdown Selected](template1.png)
2. Choosing From Template from the windowpane on the left
3. Scrolling down until you see the rUM templates ![Picture of dialog box with "From Template" selected and "html2 with rUM" highlighted](template2.png)
4. Click OK
