## Introduction

With `write_slides()` you can save a deck into a package. To learn about that function look at the [Creating Slides with write_slides()](ah_write_slides.html)  vignette. How can you check to see if a package contains slides?  If there is one or more deck, how can you see the slides?

## Getting Started

To see if a package has slides use `rUM::find_slides()`. If you want to know if the `rUM` package has slides, you would check with:

`find_slides("rUM")`
 
It will give you an object containing the names of the slide decks. 
 
```{r}
rUM::find_slides("rUM")
```

To see the slide deck use `rUM::show_slides()`.  For example to see the slide deck called **rUM_the_package** from inside the `rUM` package you would type:

`rUM::show_slides("rUM", "rUM_the_package")`

You can also pipe from `rUM::find_slides()` to `rUM::show_slides()` like this and it will ask you to choose which slide deck:

```r
> find_slides('rUM') |> show_slides()
Select a slide deck from "rUM" package: 

1: rUM_the_package
2: rUM_the_word

Selection: 1
```
