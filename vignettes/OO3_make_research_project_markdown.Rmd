## Introduction
This is a collection of document templates, available through R, from your friends at the University of Miami (UM). $R+UM=rUM$

The `rUM` package will help you create research manuscripts by removing the configuration hassles commonly encountered when learning to write papers using R. `rUM` will initialize a new RStudio project and a Markdown file that includes the outline for a research paper. The Markdown file comes preconfigured with a YAML header (don't worry if you don't know what that means yet) with code chunks to load the `tidyverse` and `conflicted` packages. Manuscript sections have been created for Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusion, and References. The project also includes a `.gitignore` file which is designed to help protect against accidentally leaking data when using git with websites like [www.github.com](https://github.com/).

rUM's documentation can be found here:

## How do I get `RMarkdown` and `rUM`? (Add a "quart o' `rUM`"!)

1.  Modern version RStudio (v2022.07 or later) ships with R Markdown integrated into the RStudio IDE.

2.  Add `rUM` to your computer by:

    -   using RStudio: click on the Packages tab in the bottom right windowpane, click the Install button, type ***rUM***, and click Install.
    -   downloading rUM from CRAN and installing it by running this code in R console:

    ``` r
    install.packages("rUM")
    ```

    -   downloading the latest version of rUM from GitHub by running commands into the R console:

    ``` r
    if (!requireNamespace("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_github("RaymondBalise/rUM")
    ```

3.  Use `rUM` by running this in the console of RStudio:

``` r
library(rUM)
```

## Ordering `rUM` from the Menu

To create a research project that uses `rUM`, follow these steps. This will initialize a new RStudio project that has an [`analysis.Rmd`](#fig:analysis_Rmd_file) R Markdown file using the `tidyverse` and `conflicted` packages and some other useful files which are described [below](#stuff).

1.  Using the RStudio menus, choose: File \> New Project \> New Directory

2.  Scroll down and then select **`rUM` Research Project Template**

    ![rUM Research Project Template](project_template.png){width=70%}

3.  Specify the location of where your research project will be saved

    ![Choose location to save your rUM project in RStudio](save_markdown_project_here.png){width=70%}
    

## Add `rUM` into an existing folder/directory that does not have an RStudio project.

What if you have already created a folder containing the important files for your project? Create a new project in your existing folder! This will now be your project directory (complete with a `.Rproj` file).

1.  Navigate to File \> New Project \> Existing Directory

2.  Specify the location of where your research project will be saved

    ![Existing project working directory window in RStudio](existing_directory.png){width=70%}
    
3.  Run the following script in your console:

``` r
# Change the text inside the quotes on the next line to indicate the path to your folder/directory.
PATH <- "~/Documents/blah"   

make_project(PATH, type = "R Markdown (analysis.Rmd)")
```

## After your `rUM` has been served

A new project directory has been created and it will be populated with [these files](#fig:created_rUM_markdown_files):

-   An aggressive `.gitignore` to help prevent the unintended sharing of sensitive study information or protected health information (PHI).
-   [`analysis.Rmd`](#fig:analysis_Rmd_file) is a Markdown template for writing your research project. It has a preconfigured YAML header; Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusion, and Reference sections; and a code chunk to construct your bibliography using `knitr::write_bib()`.
-   An empty folder named `data`. This folder is listed within the `.gitignore`. That means that git should not track these files. This should help prevent data leakage but be sure to talk to a data security expert before sharing any biomedical projects on websites like GitHub.
-   A `.Rproj` file with the same name as your project folder.
-   Two text files, `packages.bib` and `references.bib`, which are used to hold details for your paper's bibliography. Refer to the Methods and References sections, respectively, within the [`analysis.Rmd`](#fig:analysis_Rmd_file) file for initial examples of how to add/use references.
-   [`the-new-england-journal-of-medicine.csl`](https://www.zotero.org/styles?q=id%3Athe-new-england-journal-of-medicine) is the citation style language (CSL) based on the *New England Journal of Medicine* requirements.

## `rUM` infused Markdown headers

1. Navigate to File > New File > R Markdown

    ![Navigating the RStudio console to access R Markdown rUM headers](newfile_markdown.jpg){width=70%}

1. Select **From Template**

    ![RStudio menu window displaying to choose "html2 with rUM" to use the R Markdown headers](from_template.png){width=70%}

1. Choose a template:

* html2 with rUM
* html2 Details with rUM
* pdf2 showing LaTeX with rUM
* bookdown_site with rUM

This will create a new subdirectory in your current working directory with the same name as the name of the `.Rmd` file you specified. Within this directory, you will find the `analysis.Rmd` R Markdown file. For example, if you created an R Markdown file called `wrangle_cytometry_data.Rmd` with the steps above, then your current directory will now have a subdirectory called `wrangle_cytometry_data/` which will contain the file `wrangle_cytometry_data.Rmd` and any subsequent files from the knitting process (such as `.PDF`, `.html`, or `.docx` files created by knitting the R Markdown document).


### What are the headers

#### html2 with rUM
This is a basic web page

#### html2 Details with rUM
This is a basic web page with a table of contents

#### pdf2 showing LaTeX with rUM
PDF report where table and figures don’t float to other pages. Many thanks to <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16626462/figure-position-in-markdown-when-converting-to-pdf-with-knitr-and-pandoc>.

#### bookdown_site with rUM
A bookdown website with a good table of contents for a book
