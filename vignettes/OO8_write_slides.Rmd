## Getting Started

Write a slide deck

You get three files.  
1. A revealjs quarto slide deck
2. A theme file, named **rstudio_default-light.theme**, that shows code chunks with the colors of RStudio
3. A Sassy Cascading Style Sheet file, named slides.csss, that lets you set coloring and font options for your slide deck  
### Saving Slides into a Package

Request that the slides are saved in a **slides** folder in the **inst** folder.

rUM::write_slides("my-deck", "./inst")
