# Introduction
This is collection of R things from your friends at UM (the University of Miami).

`rUM` includes:
* A research project template. It creates a new RStudio project that has an analysis R markdown file with tidyverse and conflicted.
* R Markdown templates which include they YAML header and start up blocks that load the tidyverse and conflicted packages.

The plan is to add UM thesis and dissertation Markdown templates.



# rUM on the Menu
1. <https://raymondbalise.github.io/rUM/>

1. <https://github.com/RaymondBalise/rUM>

1. or
```r
if (!require("remotes")) installed.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_cran("rUM")

library(rUM)
```


# Mix your own rUM
We would like to create a research project, so we use the `rUM` package. It creates a new RStudio project that has an analysis R markdown file using the `tidyverse` and `conflicted` packages. For more advanced analysis, we can also create R markdown files which use the `tidymodels` package.

## Setup
1. Use File > New Project > New Directory
1. Scroll down and then select **Research Project Template**

    ![](project_template.png){width=50%}

1. Specify where you want your research project to be saved.

    ![](save_project_here.png){width=50%}

You will now have a new project directory created 



## Session
If you are new to R, ignore this.
```{r}
