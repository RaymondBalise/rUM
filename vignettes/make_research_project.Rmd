# Introduction
This is collection of R things from your friends at UM (the University of Miami).

`rUM` includes:
* A research project template. It creates a new RStudio project that has an analysis R markdown file with tidyverse and conflicted.
* R Markdown templates which include they YAML header and start up blocks that load the tidyverse and conflicted packages.

The plan is to add UM thesis and dissertation Markdown templates.

# rUM on the Menu
We would like to create a research project, so we use the `rUM` package. It creates a new RStudio project that has an analysis R markdown file using the `tidyverse` and `conflicted` packages. For more advanced analysis, we can also create R markdown files which use the `tidymodels` package.

## Setup
(To create a research project, see the steps here: <https://raymondbalise.github.io/rUM/>.)



## Session
If you are new to R, ignore this.
