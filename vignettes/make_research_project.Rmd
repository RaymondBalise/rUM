# Introduction
We would like to create a research project, so we use the `rUM` package. It creates a new RStudio project that has an analysis R markdown file using the `tidyverse` and `conflicted` packages. For more advanced analysis, we can also create R markdown files which use the `tidymodels` package.


# Setup
To create a research project, see the steps here: <https://raymondbalise.github.io/rUM/>.


# Session
If you are new to R, ignore this.
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```
