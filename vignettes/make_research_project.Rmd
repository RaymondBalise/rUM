## Introduction
This is collection of R things from your friends at UM (the University of Miami).

The `rUM` package will allow you to create powerful research manuscripts by taking the structure guesswork and configuration hassles out of the equation. `rUM` will create a new RStudio project and research boilerplate R Markdown file, complete with a YAML header requiring minimal customization. The R Markdown file also comes preconfigured with start up blocks that load the `tidyverse` and `conflicted` packages, and sections for Introduction, Method, Results, Conclusion, and References. Ensure the highest standards of data integrity by using the enhanced `.gitignore` file.

Future versions will add UM thesis and dissertation Markdown templates, and options to create Quarto documents.



## Getting `rUM` for your project
1. <https://raymondbalise.github.io/rUM/>

1. <https://github.com/RaymondBalise/rUM>

1. or
```r
if (!require("remotes")) installed.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_cran("rUM")

library(rUM)
```


## Ordering `rUM` the easy way

We would like to create a research project, so we use the `rUM` package. It creates a new RStudio project that has an analysis R markdown file using the `tidyverse` and `conflicted` packages. For more advanced analysis, we can also create R markdown files which use the `tidymodels` package.

1. Navigate to File > New Project > New Directory
1. Scroll down and then select **Research Project Template**

1. Specify the location of where your research project will be saved.

## Mixing `rUM` yourself

What if you already have already created a folder containing important files for your project? Pretty easy... just create a new project in your existing folder! This will now be your project directory (with the `*.Rproj`). 

1. Navigate to File > New Project > Existing Directory
1. Specify the location of where your research project will be saved.

    ![](existing_directory.png){width=70%}
    
1. Run the following script in your console:

```
PATH <- getwd()
make_project(PATH)
```


Let the `rUM` soak in and easy your worries.



## Your `rUM` is now served

A new project directory has been created and it will be populated with [these files](#fig:created_rUM_files):

* An aggressive `.gitignore` to prevent the unintended sharing of sensitive study information or protected health information (PHI).
* [`analysis.Rmd`](#fig:analysis_markdown) is a markdown boilerplate for writing your research project. It has a preconfigured YAML header; setup chunk; Introduction, Methods, Results, Conclusion, and Reference sections; and a code chunk to construct your bibliography using `knitr::write_bib()`.
* An empty folder named `data`. This folder is also listed in the `.gitignore` meaning that files stored in this folder are also safe from accidental disclosure.
* A .Rproj with the same name as your project folder.
* `packages.bib` and `references.bib` to be filled as you progress in your research project writing (refer to the Methods and References sections, respectively, within the `analysis.Rmd` file for initial examples of how to use).
* `the-new-england-journal-of-medicine.csl` is the citation style language (CSL) based on the [New England Journal of Medicine](https://catalyst.nejm.org/pb-assets/images/NEJM%20Catalyst%20Reference%20style-1589400257323.pdf) recommendations and best practices.
