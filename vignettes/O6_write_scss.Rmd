## Introduction

Customizing the appearance of your Quarto documents doesn't have to be complicated. The `write_scss()` function simplifies the process of creating and managing SCSS style sheets, making it easier to achieve the exact look you want for your documents.

## Getting Started

When you create a new Quarto project with `rUM::make_project()`, your YAML header typically looks like this:

````yaml
format:
  html:
    embed-resources: true
    theme:
      - default
      - custom.scss
````

The default `custom.scss` provides a foundation for styling, but you might want to add additional style sheets for different purposes. Let's explore how to do this effectively.

## Creating Additional Style Sheets

Let's say you want to create a new style sheet called "styles.scss". This is as simple as:

````r
rUM::write_scss("styles")
````

After running this command, your YAML will automatically update to:

````yaml
format:
  html:
    embed-resources: true
    theme:
      - default
      - custom.scss
      - styles.scss
````

## Customizing Styles

Now that we have our new style sheet, let's modify it to change the background color to a light gray. Open `styles.scss` and modify the background color variable by removing the SCSS comment (`//`) and altering the hex code value for `$body-bg`:

````
/*-- scss:defaults --*/
// Colors
$body-bg: #f5f5f5;    // Light gray background
````

You can keep adding style sheets as needed. For example, let's add another one for additional customizations:

````r
rUM::write_scss("more_styles")
````

Your YAML will now include all three styles sheets:

````yaml
format:
  html:
    embed-resources: true
    theme:
      - default
      - custom.scss
      - styles.scss
      - more_styles.scss
````

## Handling Different YAML Structures

Sometimes you might encounter or create a Quarto document with a different YAML structure. In these cases, `write_scss()` provides helpful guidance. For example, if the function doesn't find the expected YAML structure, you'll see this console message:

````
Be sure to update your listed SCSS files in the YAML manually:
format:
  html:
    embed-resources: true
    theme:
      - default
      - custom.scss
      - your_new_style.scss       # Add this line
````

This ensures you can still proceed with your customization, even if your YAML structure differs from the default.

## Why Use Multiple Style Sheets?

Using multiple SCSS files can be advantageous when:

- Organizing different aspects of your styling (typography, colors, layout)

- Maintaining separate themes for different purposes

- Collaborating with others who need to modify specific style elements

- Testing different style combinations without modifying your base styles

## Conclusion

The `write_scss()` function makes it straightforward to expand your Quarto document's styling capabilities while maintaining a clean, organized structure. Whether you're making simple color changes or developing complex themes, this tool helps you focus on creativity rather than file management.
